        <h1>Site purpose - Elevator pitch</h1>
        <p>I often ask myself, how much time, money and personal progress would we save if we didn't have to deal with
            illnesses and health problems? For example it would be something incredible
            that in a work environment like in a company the employees enjoy good health, this would bring
            a more effective job due to his good mood as well as his lack of setbacks for his health.
            One of the main causes of health problems and diseases is not having a healthy body weight and it is very
            easy to lose control of it.

            Would you like to benefit the health of your employees for better performance?
            I have a project in mind which is to design a website with relevant information about healthy body weight
            and how to avoid diseases resulting from uncontrolled weight.
